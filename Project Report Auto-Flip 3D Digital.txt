Project Report: Auto-Flip 3D Digital Library

Project Overview: A Dynamic Web Application for Automated PDF Library Management

1. Executive Summary
The goal of this project was to create a digital library capable of hosting over 1,000 storybooks. The core challenge was to move away from manual HTML updates and create a system that automatically detects new content. The final solution uses a Full-Stack architecture where a Node.js backend serves a dynamic frontend, providing a seamless 3D "flipbook" experience for the user.

2. Technical Architecture
The project is built using three primary layers:

A. The Backend (Node.js & Express)
Instead of a static file system, we implemented a server-side script (server.js).

Function: It uses the fs (File System) module to scan the /books directory in real-time.

API Endpoint: It exposes a REST API (/api/books) that returns a JSON list of all available PDF files. This ensures that the library is always up-to-date without touching the code.

B. The Frontend (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript)
The interface is designed for high performance and usability.

Dynamic Rendering: Using the JavaScript fetch API, the frontend retrieves the book list and builds the library grid dynamically.

Search Functionality: A real-time filter allows users to search through titles instantly using lowercase string matching.

C. The 3D Engine (DearFlip)
To provide a "Real Book" feel, we integrated the DearFlip plugin.

WebGL Technology: This allows the PDFs to be rendered as 3D objects that the user can interact with (flipping pages, hearing sound effects).

Encoded URI Handling: The system automatically handles special characters (spaces, commas, apostrophes) in filenames so that the browser can open them without 404 errors.

3. Data Preparation: The PDF Splitting Process
One of the most important steps in this project was the optimization of the source files.

The Problem: Many digital PDFs (such as those generated by AI or standard scanners) are saved as "Spread Views" where two pages appear as one wide image. This breaks the 3D flipping logic, which expects a single-page-per-sheet format.

The Solution: We used a bulk-processing method (via PDF24 Creator) to "Halve" the pages.

The Tool: We used the "Split PDF" tool with the "Halve pages" setting.

The Result: This transformed wide 2-page spreads into individual vertical pages. This allows the 3D engine to "fold" the book down the middle correctly, creating a realistic reading experience.

4. Key Features Implemented
Zero-Maintenance Updates: Adding a book is as simple as dragging a file into a folder.

URL Safety: Automatic encoding of filenames to prevent link breakage.

Fixed-Header Navigation: The search bar stays at the top of the screen for easy access during scrolling.

Cross-Device Compatibility: The server-client model allows the library to be accessed by any device on the same network.

5. Conclusion & Future Roadmap
The project successfully automates the management of a large-scale digital library. Future iterations will include:

Database Integration: Moving from a folder-scan to a database (MongoDB) for even faster performance.

User Authentication: Allowing different users to have "favorites" or "bookmarks."

Cloud Hosting: Deploying the Node.js server to a live URL for public access.

6. System Operation & Execution Manual
To ensure the library remains functional and scalable, the following operational workflow must be followed:

A. Execution Environment
The application requires a Node.js Runtime Environment. Unlike basic HTML files that can be opened by double-clicking, this application uses a Web Server to handle file system requests.

Steps to Launch:

Initialize the Server: Open the terminal in the project root and execute node server.js.

Port Listening: The server begins "listening" on Port 3000.

Client Access: The user accesses the interface via http://localhost:3000.

B. The Automated Update Workflow (Adding Books)
The project is designed for "Zero-Code" updates. When a new book is ready:

Preparation: Ensure the PDF is split into single pages (Halved) if it was originally a spread.

Injection: Drop the .pdf file into the /books folder.

Synchronization: No server restart is required. The next time the webpage is refreshed, the API (/api/books) performs a new directory scan and populates the UI with the new title.

C. Search & Filter Logic
The search bar uses an Event Listener (onkeyup).

Every time a key is pressed, the system compares the input string against the allBooks array stored in the browser's memory.

It uses case-insensitive matching, so "STORY" and "story" will both return the same results.

This ensures that even with 1,000+ books, the user finds the specific file in milliseconds.

D. Why We Use Node.js Instead of Python/Live Server
While Python’s http.server is useful for viewing static files, it cannot "list" a directory's contents to a webpage automatically. By using Node.js (Express), we created a custom API endpoint. This is the difference between a "Static Site" and a "Dynamic Web App."
